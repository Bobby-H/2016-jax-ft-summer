# boolean values always circulate around wheather something is:
# true || false, right || wrong, yes || no
#here is a break down of how ruby evalutates boolean conditions:

== => equals to                  |  0 == 1 is false
!= => not equal to               |  0 != 1 is true
>  => greater than               |  0 >  1 is false
<  => less than                  |  0 >= 1 is false
>= => greater than or equal to   |  0 <  1 is true
<= => less than or equal to      |  0 <= 1 is true

# other conditionals to add to your tool belt:
|| => 'or' => if either condition can be true, the expression will evaluate to true
&& => 'and' => where both conditions must be true for the expression to evaluate as true.
